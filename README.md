# SoliddSteelMod
Solidd Steel is a Minecraft mod that adds a new material called Solidd Steel. It is an upgrade to iron that works in the same way netherite upgrades diamond.

I mostly created this to get comfortable with 1.18 mod development but I find it is a fun fit between the iron and diamond stages of the game.
